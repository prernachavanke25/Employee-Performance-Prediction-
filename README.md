# Employee-Performance-Prediction-
Employee Performance Prediction is a Machine Learning based project that aims to predict the performance level of employees based on various features such as experience, education level, promotions, and other relevant features. The dataset is preprocessed using techniques such as handling missing values, encoding and feature scaling to improve model accuracy. 
# Features
- Predict employee performance instantly
- Uses Machine Learning algorithms(Linear Regression, KNN, SVM)
- Apply feature engineering and Data Preprocessing
- Develope the frontend usind Streamlit
- Develope the backend using FastAPI
# Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Streamlit
- FastAPI
- Scikit-Learn
# Machine Learning Model
Algorithms Used:
- KNeighborsClassifier(KNN)
This model is gives the best accuracy score on both the training and testing data,so I used this model for the project.
